Hi! My name is Joshua Ashmall-Liversidge and I make websites using primarily React and Rails, but others as well (use '<span class="emphasis">skills</span>' for full list). I love solving complex problems and implementing interesting UIs. I'm always excited to learn new languages, frameworks, and tools. 

Outside of code, I enjoy reading sci-fi, riding my bike, and watching soccer games (YNWAðŸ§£).
